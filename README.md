## Project: Social Media Sentiment Analysis
# 1. Objective

Analyze people’s opinions, emotions, and attitudes towards a brand, product, or event using social media data (Twitter, Reddit, YouTube comments, etc.).

# 2. Problem Statement

Companies receive tons of feedback through social media. Manual analysis is impossible at scale. This project aims to:

Collect social media data.

Preprocess and clean the data.

Apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

Perform sentiment classification (Positive, Negative, Neutral).

Visualize insights for business use.

# 3. Tech Stack

Programming: Python

Libraries:

Data Collection: snscrape, tweepy, praw (Reddit API), googleapiclient (YouTube)

NLP & ML: NLTK, TextBlob, spaCy, transformers (BERT, RoBERTa)

Data Handling: pandas, numpy

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, wordcloud

Deployment: Streamlit / Flask / FastAPI

Optional: Power BI / Tableau for dashboards

# 4. Workflow
Step 1: Data Collection

Scrape tweets using hashtags (#BrandName, #Event2025).

Collect YouTube comments (product reviews, speeches, music videos).

Reddit threads on trending topics.

Step 2: Data Preprocessing

Remove emojis, special characters, stopwords.

Tokenization, Lemmatization/Stemming.

Handle slang & abbreviations ("gr8" → "great").

Step 3: Sentiment Analysis

Rule-Based: Using TextBlob / VADER (quick setup).

Machine Learning: Train ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest).

Deep Learning: Use BERT or RoBERTa for state-of-the-art accuracy.

Step 4: Visualization & Insights

Sentiment distribution (Pie/Bar Chart).

WordCloud for positive/negative tweets.

Trend analysis (sentiment over time).

Compare sentiment across platforms.

Step 5: Deployment

Build a Streamlit app where users can enter a keyword/hashtag and get sentiment insights.

Or deploy API using Flask/FastAPI to serve sentiment predictions.

# 5. Example Use Cases

Brand Monitoring: Track what people are saying about "Nike" on Twitter.

Political Sentiment: Analyze public opinion about elections.

Product Launch: See how customers feel about a new iPhone release.

Customer Service: Detect negative feedback early.

# 6. Extra Features (Advanced)

Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (e.g., "Camera is great but battery life sucks").

Real-time streaming sentiment (using Twitter API v2 streaming).

Multilingual sentiment detection.

Dashboard in Power BI/Tableau connected to cleaned dataset.

# 7. Sample Output

Sentiment:

Positive: 65%

Neutral: 20%

Negative: 15%

Trending Positive Words: “love, amazing, fast, great”

Trending Negative Words: “slow, expensive, disappointed”

Graphs: Line chart of sentiment trend, WordCloud, Pie chart of sentiment categories.
